# Physics AR

Physics AR takes the concept of point charges and electric field lines and brings them to the real world. Through the use of augmented reality, a teacher hosts a room, where he or she can create charged particles on flat surfaces like tables or the floor. Students can join the room and view how the particles interact in 3D space. Winner of Best Use of Google Cloud API at Hack Holyoke 2018.
